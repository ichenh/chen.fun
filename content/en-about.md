## This site

- Why blogging?
  1. It's cool.
  2. It's personalized.
  3. To accumulate a sense of achievement.
- This site is powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) being the default Markdown handler, deployed on a [Huawei cloud server](https://activity.huaweicloud.com/cps/recommendstore.html?fromacct=5e9a4441-a665-456a-b905-9ade780e0da0&utm_source=V1g3MDY4NTY=&utm_medium=cps&utm_campaign=201905), and supported by [Upyun CDN](https://console.upyun.com/register/?invite=SkO_nj9ld). Part of the layout and CSS style use [xmin](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin), [$\LaTeX$.css](https://latex.now.sh/), and [MemE](https://github.com/reuixiy/hugo-theme-meme) as references. In addition, mathematical formulae are displayed by the [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) engine.
